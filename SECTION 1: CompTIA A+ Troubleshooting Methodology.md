CompTIA recommends a **6-step troubleshooting process:**

- Identify the Problem
  - Gather information (user input, error messages, device behavior)
  - Duplicate the problem, if possible
  - Perform a backup before making any changes
  - Question users (what changed recently?)
- Establish a Theory of Probable Cause
  - Start with the obvious (loose cable, power)
  - Use the OSI model to segment where the issue might be (physical, data link, network layers, etc.)
- Test the Theory
  - Confirm the cause through testing
  - If theory fails, go back to step 2 with a new theory
- Establish a Plan of Action
  - Determine fix steps
  - Identify potential impacts
- Implement the Solution
  - Apply the fix carefully
  - Monitor for immediate results
- Verify Full System Functionality
  - Ensure the issue is resolved
  - Perform preventive measures (e.g., driver updates, user training)
- Document Findings
  - Record symptoms, solution, and preventative steps
